      <p class="speaker">TOUCHSTONE</p>
      <p>We shall find a time, Audrey; patience, gentle Audrey.</p>

      <p class="speaker">AUDREY</p>
      <p>Faith, the priest was good enough, for all the old gentleman’s saying.</p>

      <p class="speaker">TOUCHSTONE</p>
      <p>A most wicked Sir Oliver, Audrey, a most vile Martext. But, Audrey, there is a youth here in the forest lays claim to you.</p>

      <p class="speaker">AUDREY</p>
      <p>Ay, I know who ’tis; he hath no interest in me in the world: here comes the man you mean.</p>

      <p class="speaker">TOUCHSTONE</p>
      <p>It is meat and drink to me to see a clown: by my troth, we that have good wits have much to answer for; we shall be flouting; we cannot hold.</p>

      <p class="stage-direction">Enter WILLIAM</p>

      <p class="speaker">WILLIAM</p>
      <p>Good even, Audrey.</p>

      <p class="speaker">AUDREY</p>
      <p>God ye good even, William.</p>

      <p class="speaker">WILLIAM</p>
      <p>And good even to you, sir.</p>

      <p class="speaker">TOUCHSTONE</p>
      <p>Good even, gentle friend. Cover thy head, cover thy head; nay, prithee, be covered. How old are you, friend?</p>

      <p class="speaker">WILLIAM</p>
      <p>Five and twenty, sir.</p>

      <p class="speaker">TOUCHSTONE</p>
      <p>A ripe age. Is thy name William?</p>

      <p class="speaker">WILLIAM</p>
      <p>William, sir.</p>

      <p class="speaker">TOUCHSTONE</p>
      <p>A fair name. Wast born i’ the forest here?</p>

      <p class="speaker">WILLIAM</p>
      <p>Ay, sir, I thank God.</p>

      <p class="speaker">TOUCHSTONE</p>
      <p>’Thank God;’ a good answer. Art rich?</p>

      <p class="speaker">WILLIAM</p>
      <p>Faith, sir, so so.</p>

      <p class="speaker">TOUCHSTONE</p>
      <p>’So so’ is good, very good, very excellent good; and yet it is not; it is but so so. Art thou wise?</p>

      <p class="speaker">WILLIAM</p>
      <p>Ay, sir, I have a pretty wit.</p>

      <p class="speaker">TOUCHSTONE</p>
      <p>Why, thou sayest well. I do now remember a saying, ‘The fool doth think he is wise, but the wise man knows himself to be a fool.’ The heathen philosopher, when he had a desire to eat a grape, would open his lips when he put it into his mouth; meaning thereby that grapes were made to eat and lips to open. You do love this maid?</p>

      <p class="speaker">WILLIAM</p>
      <p>I do, sir.</p>

      <p class="speaker">TOUCHSTONE</p>
      <p>Give me your hand. Art thou learned?</p>

      <p class="speaker">WILLIAM</p>
      <p>No, sir.</p>

      <p class="speaker">TOUCHSTONE</p>
      <p>Then learn this of me: to have, is to have; for it is a figure in rhetoric that drink, being poured out of a cup into a glass, by filling the one doth empty the other; for all your writers do consent that ipse is he: now, you are not ipse, for I am he.</p>

      <p class="speaker">WILLIAM</p>
      <p>Which he, sir?</p>

      <p class="speaker">TOUCHSTONE</p>
      <p>He, sir, that must marry this woman. Therefore, you clown, abandon,—which is in the vulgar leave,—the society,—which in the boorish is company,—of this female,—which in the common is woman; which together is, abandon the society of this female, or, clown, thou perishest; or, to thy better understanding, diest; or, to wit I kill thee, make thee away, translate thy life into death, thy liberty into bondage: I will deal in poison with thee, or in bastinado, or in steel; I will bandy with thee in faction; I will o’errun thee with policy; I will kill thee a hundred and fifty ways: therefore tremble and depart.</p>

      <p class="speaker">AUDREY</p>
      <p>Do, good William.</p>

      <p class="speaker">WILLIAM</p>
      <p>God rest you merry, sir.</p>

      <p class="stage-direction">Exit</p>
      <p class="stage-direction">Enter CORIN — Our master and mistress seeks you; come, away, away! TOUCHSTONE — Trip, Audrey! trip, Audrey! I attend, I attend. Exeunt.</p>

      <p>In converting the excerpt, I structured the HTML with semantic tags: header, main, section, footer. Challenges included preserving stage directions and speaker labels in a readable way. I included a script to dynamically populate “Last Modified” based on the file timestamp to satisfy that rubric requirement. I validated the HTML and ensured indentation and structure are clear.</p>
